	<h1>Job and the Heavenly/Angelic Mediator <em>(of Saints and Men)</em></h1>
	<p>1. First, Eliphaz the Temanite asks Job to whom among the holy ones, that is, angels, or heavenly beings, he will turn for help and implies that there was none [Job 5:2]</p>
	<p>2. Now, while Eliphaz implied Job had no heavenly representative, Job testified differently. Job spoke with total certainty of a redeemer—“My Redeemer”—who will bring about his resurrection from the dead—“I know that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">my Redeemer</span> lives, and that in the end he will stand upon the earth.” [Job 19:25-27].</p>
	<p>3. Elihu, following the elders, then speaks of an “angel …out of a thousand” standing for Job <em>or any man for the matter who has been appointed to death</em>, to find a ransom for him and spare him from going down to the grave [Job 33:19-26ff]. The man saved from death will say, “He redeemed me” [Job 33:28]</p>
