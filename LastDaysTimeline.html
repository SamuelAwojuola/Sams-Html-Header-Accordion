		<h2>A Basic Chronology of Events in the Last Days</h2>
		<h3>When the Last Days Begin?</h3>
		
		<div id="font">
		<p>Hebrews divided time in two [Heb 1:1-2]:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>The Past Days <em>(when God spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways) [Heb 1:1].</em> And</li>
		<li>The Last Days <em>(when God spoke to us by His Son Jesus)</em> [Heb 1:2].</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>So, we see, that the last days began in the days of John the Baptist and Jesus Christ [Mat 11:13]</p>
		<p>We have confimation in the words of Peter in the Upper Room on the Day of Pentecost that they were already in the last days and this is in fulfillment of Joel's prophecy [Joel 2:28 <em>cf.,</em> Act 2:16-17]</p>
		<p>Below is a basic chronology of events in the last days.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 18px"><em>(Please click on each event to see more.)</em></p>
