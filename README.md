# Sams-Html-Header-Accordion
This turns a regular html document into an accordion using the headers (H1 to H6).
All that is required is to link the js file in the html document, there is no need to modify the html code, there is no need to add classes or ids anywhere.
However, please do not add a display style to the headers in the style sheet.
